add RFmodulator
  a sideband generator which matches frequency componenets
  with frequency and amplitude noise inputs

modify getXxxName function to support multiple numbers
  with no number argument, return all names
  with vector of numbers, return cell array of names

write lock function
  given a sensing matrix, an offset vector, an initial position, and a set of adjustable drives
  return a position which has all zero error signals
  allow error function instead of sensing matrix

write sigAC reducer
  given sensing matrix and drive matrix, return mSens * sigAC * mDrive

support alignment signals
  allow for basis specification at each optic (e.g., cavity basis)
  make input basis specification user-friendly
  improve addSource example (include basis contruction)

clean up the BeamSplitter - reduce code duplication with Mirror
  make BS contain a Mirror?

write display functions for each to display type specific information

make sources squeezable
