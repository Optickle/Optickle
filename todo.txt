write lock function
  given a sensing matrix, an offset vector, an initial position, and a set of adjustable drives
  return a position which has all zero error signals
  allow error function instead of sensing matrix

write sigAC reducer
  given sensing matrix and drive matrix, return mSens * sigAC * mDrive

support alignment signals
  allow for basis specification at each optic (e.g., cavity basis)
  make input basis specification user-friendly
  improve addSource example (include basis contruction)

clean up the BeamSplitter - reduce code duplication with Mirror
  make BS contain a Mirror?

write display functions for each to display type specific information

make sources squeezable
