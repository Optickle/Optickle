% Compute AC transfer functions for a TEM01 mode (pitch).
%
% [sigAC, mMech] = tickle01(opt, pos, f)
% opt - Optickle model
% pos - optic positions (Ndrive x 1, or empty)
% f - audio frequency vector (Naf x 1)
%
% sigAC - transfer matrix (Nprobe x Ndrive x Naf),
%   where Ndrive is the total number of optic drive
%   inputs (e.g., 1 for a mirror, 2 for a RFmodulator).
%   Thus, sigAC is arranged such that sigAC(n, m, :)
%   is the TF from the drive m to probe n.
% mMech - modified drive transfer functions (Ndrv x Ndrv x Naf)
%
% Example:
% f = logspace(0, 3, 300);
% opt = optFP;
% [sigAC, mMech] = tickle01(opt, [], f);
%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% With control struct
% sOpt = tickle(opt, pos, sCon)
%
% An alternate means of using tickle01 is to pass a control struct
% as the third argument.  See tickle and convertSimulink for details.
%
% As with tickle, but for the pitch degree-of-freedom, the result is
% Optickle system struct which contains the following fields:
%   mPlant - transfer from control outputs to control inputs
%            this is taken from sigAC and mMech
%   mOpenLoop - open loop tranfer at control outputs
%               mOpenLoop = sCon.mCon * mPlant
%   mCloseLoop - close loop transfer at control outputs
%                mCloseLoop = inv(eye(mCon.Nout) - mOpenLoop)
%   mInOut - transfer from control inputs to control outputs with loops
%            mInOut = mCloseLoop * sCon.mCon;

function varargout = tickle01(opt, pos, f)

  % === Argument Handling
  if nargin < 3
    error('No frequency vector given.  Use tickle for DC results.')
  end

  % third argument is actually control struct (see convertSimulink)
  isCon = isstruct(f);
