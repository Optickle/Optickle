  % ==== DC Fields and Signals
  % Here, the DC fields for each RF component are evaluated
  % at each field evaluation point (FEP, at each link end).
  %
  % Using the DC fields in vDC, we can now finish the probe
  % matrix Mprb, and with that we can compute the DC signals.
  %
  % For easier use outside this function, the DC fields are
  % reshaped and returned in a matrix fDC, which is Nlnk x Nrf.
