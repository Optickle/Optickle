% Compute DC fields, and DC signals, and AC transfer functions
%
% [fDC, sigDC, mOpt, mMech, noiseAC, noiseMech] = tickle(opt, pos, f, nDrive)
% opt       - Optickle model
% pos       - optic positions (Ndrive x 1, or empty)
% f         - audio frequency vector (Naf x 1)
%
% fDC       - DC fields at this position (Nlink x Nrf)
%             where Nlink is the number of links, and Nrf
%             is the number of RF frequency components.
% sigDC     - DC signals for each probe (Nprobe x 1)
%             where Nprobe is the number of probes.
% mOpt      - optical transfer matrix (Nout x Nin x Naf),
%             where Nin is the total number of optic drive
%             inputs (e.g., 1 for a mirror, 2 for a RFmodulator).
%             Thus, sigAC is arranged such that sigAC(n, m, :)
%             is the TF from input m to output n.
%             NOTE: if mProbeOut is empty, the outputs are all probes
%               similarly, if mInDrv is empty, the inputs are all drives
% mMech     - opto-mechanical modification of the inputs (Nin x Nin x Naf)
%             if there are no opto-mechanics, this will be the identity.
%             NOTE: mMech does NOT include the mechanical response to
%             force (i.e., MechTF).
%
% noiseOut   - quantum noise at each output/probe (Nout x Naf)
% noiseMech - quantum noise at each input/drive (Nin x Naf)
%
% UNITS:
% Assuming the input laser power is in Watts, and laser wavelength is in
% meters, the outputs are generically 
% fDC   - [sqrt(W)]
% sigDC - [W]
% mOpt - [W/m]  assuming the drive is a mirror. 
%  If the drive is a modulator, then mOpt is [W/AM] or [W/rad] for
%  an amplitude or phase modulation, respectively.  Generally, the
%  units are W/(drive unit).
% mMech - [m/m]  again, generally this is (drive unit)/(drive unit)
%
% EXAMPLE:
% f = logspace(0, 3, 300);
% opt = optFP;
% [fDC, sigDC, sigAC, mMech] = tickle(opt, [], f);
