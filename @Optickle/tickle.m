% Compute DC fields, and DC signals, and AC transfer functions
%
% [fDC, sigDC, sigAC, mMech, noiseAC, noiseMech] = tickle(opt, pos, f, nDrive)
% opt       - Optickle model
% pos       - optic positions (Ndrive x 1, or empty)
% f         - audio frequency vector (Naf x 1)
% nDrive    - drive indices to consider (Nx1, default is all)
%
% fDC       - DC fields at this position (Nlink x Nrf)
%             where Nlink is the number of links, and Nrf
%             is the number of RF frequency components.
% sigDC     - DC signals for each probe (Nprobe x 1)
%             where Nprobe is the number of probes.
% sigAC     - transfer matrix (Nprobe x Ndrive x Naf),
%             where Ndrive is the total number of optic drive
%             inputs (e.g., 1 for a mirror, 2 for a RFmodulator).
%             Thus, sigAC is arranged such that sigAC(n, m, :)
%             is the TF from the drive m to probe n.
% mMech     - modified drive transfer functions (Ndrv x Ndrv x Naf)
% noiseAC   - quantum noise at each probe (Nprb x Naf)
% noiseMech - quantum noise at each drive (Ndrv x Naf)
%
% UNITS:
% Assuming the input laser power is in Watts, and laser wavelength is in
% meters, the outputs are generically 
% fDC   - [sqrt(W)]
% sigDC - [W]
% sigAC - [W/m]
% assuming the drive is a mirror. If the drive is a modulator, then sigAC
% is [W/AM] or [W/rad] for an amplitude or phase modulation, respectively.

% EXAMPLE:
% f = logspace(0, 3, 300);
% opt = optFP;
% [fDC, sigDC, sigAC, mMech] = tickle(opt, [], f);
