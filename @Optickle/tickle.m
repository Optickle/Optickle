% Compute DC fields, and DC signals, and AC transfer functions
%
% [fDC, sigDC, sigAC, mMech, noiseAC, noiseMech] = tickle(opt, pos, f)
% opt - Optickle model
% pos - optic positions (Ndrive x 1, or empty)
% f - audio frequency vector (Naf x 1)
%
% fDC - DC fields at this position (Nlink x Nrf)
%   where Nlink is the number of links, and Nrf
%   is the number of RF frequency components.
% sigDC - DC signals for each probe (Nprobe x 1)
%  where Nprobe is the number of probes.
% sigAC - transfer matrix (Nprobe x Ndrive x Naf),
%   where Ndrive is the total number of optic drive
%   inputs (e.g., 1 for a mirror, 2 for a RFmodulator).
%   Thus, sigAC is arranged such that sigAC(n, m, :)
%   is the TF from the drive m to probe n.
% mMech - modified drive transfer functions (Ndrv x Ndrv x Naf)
% noiseAC - quantum noise at each probe (Nprb x Naf)
% noiseMech - quantum noise at each drive (Ndrv x Naf)
%
% Example:
% f = logspace(0, 3, 300);
% opt = optFP;
% [fDC, sigDC, sigAC, mMech] = tickle(opt, [], f);
%
% %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% With control struct
% [fDC, sigDC, sOpt, noiseOut] = tickle(opt, pos, sCon)
%
% An alternate means of using tickle is to pass a control struct
% as the third argument.  This control struct describes a controller
% which takes the outputs of the Optickle model (probe signals) and 
% precesses them to produce inputs to the model (drive signals).  See
% convertSimulink for more details.
%
% The control struct must contain the following fields:
%  f - frequency vector (Naf x 1)
%  Nin - control system inputs
%  Nout - control system outputs
%  mCon - control matrix for each f value (Nin x Nout x Naf)
%  mPrbIn - probe output to control system input map (Nin x Nprobe)
%  mDrvIn - drive output to control system input map (Nin x Ndrive)
%  mPrbOut - control system output to probe input map (Nprobe x  Nout)
%  mDrvOut - control system output to drive input map (Ndrive x  Nout)
%
% The results are the usual fDC and sigDC, along with an Optickle
% system struct which contains the following fields:
%  mPlant - transfer from control outputs to control inputs
%           this is taken from sigAC and mMech
%  mOpenLoop - open loop tranfer at control outputs
%              mOpenLoop = sCon.mCon * mPlant
%  mCloseLoop - close loop transfer at control outputs
%               mCloseLoop = inv(eye(mCon.Nout) - mOpenLoop)
%  mInOut - transfer from control inputs to control outputs with loops
%           mInOut = mCloseLoop * sCon.mCon;
