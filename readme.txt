Optickle is a general model for the electro-opto-mechanical
part of a GW detector.  It ventures into mechanics only as
far as is necessary to include radiation pressure effects,
and into electronics only far enough to produce demodulation
signals, and into optics only up to first order.  There are
many other tools that do all these things in greater detail.
Optickle is for quick, rough, but essentially complete design
studies.

In Optickle you can, in principle, simulate any interferometer.
There are several examples provided in the example directory.

>> cd Optickle
>> 
>> 
>> path(pathdef)
>> addpath(genpath(pwd))
>> 
>> demoDetuneFP

There is much more to say, but for now look at the examples, and
use the help command!
